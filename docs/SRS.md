# 1. Introduction

## **1.1 Purpose**

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the first release of the Campus++ web application.

Campus++ is a community-driven platform for students, applicants, and moderators of Hochschule Campus Wien (HCW). The system centralizes study program information, course details, reviews, and discussion features.

The SRS serves as a basis for design, implementation, testing, and evaluation.

## **1.2 Background and Goals**

Currently, HCW students must rely on fragmented tools such as Discord, StudyCheck, private chats, or WhatsApp groups.

There is **no central, structured platform** covering:

- all studies & courses of HCW
- student-generated course feedback
- exam experiences
- discussion threads per lecture
- platform for material sharing

**Goal:** Campus++ shall provide a centralized, community-driven academic platform tailored to HCW that:

- helps students and applicants understand courses and study programs,
- enables students to share experiences and materials,
- offers basic moderation tools to keep content helpful and respectful.

## 1.3 Product scope

Campus++ is a web application that runs in modern browsers (desktop and mobile).

Users can:

- browse study programs and courses,
- read and write reviews,
- manage favourites,
- report problematic content,
- (in later versions) upload materials and participate in discussion threads.

The technical architecture is defined in the HLD document.

## 1.4 Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations

- **HCW** – Hochschule Campus Wien.
- **Campus++** – proposed web application with course information, reviews, materials, and discussion spaces.
- **Study Program** – academic degree program (e.g., Computer Science and Digital Communications).
- **Course / Lecture** – a single teaching unit within a study program.
- **Entry** – structured information related to a study program or course (e.g. workload, semester, language of instruction).
- **Review** – user-generated rating (e.g. 1–5) with optional text for a course or study program.
- **Thread / Discussion Thread** – conversation space linked to a specific course or study program.
- **Post / Comment** – message created in a thread (post) or response to a post (comment).

    - **Student** – full read access plus write permissions (reviews, posts, comments, materials, reports).
    - **Moderator** – all student rights plus moderation actions (handle reports, hide/delete content, approve suggested edits).
- **MoSCoW Prioritization** – classification of requirements:
    - **Must** – mandatory for a usable first release.
    - **Should** – important but not strictly necessary for the first release.
    - **Could** – nice-to-have additions, implemented if time and resources permit.
    - **Won’t** – explicitly out of scope for this project.
